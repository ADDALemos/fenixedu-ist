 \n\
Your registration declaration was electronically signed and made available \n\
for download. \n\
 \n\
Because there are situations where paper is more convenient, Técnico Lisboa has \n\
attached a cover page that contains an access code to the document. The access \n\
code can be printed, resulting in a physical document that you may deliver \n\
to any public or private institution. With the access code, it is possible \n\
to download the original electronically signed document, which is valid \n\
and considered official according to the Portuguese Law. \n\
 \n\
To get the access code for your registration declaration, go to the following \n\
address: \n\
