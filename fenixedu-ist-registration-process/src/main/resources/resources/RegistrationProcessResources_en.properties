Your registration declaration was electronically signed and made available \
for download. \
 \
Because there are situations where paper is more convenient, Técnico Lisboa has \
attached a cover page that contains an access code to the document. The access \
code can be printed, resulting in a physical document that you may deliver \
to any public or private institution. With the access code, it is possible \
to download the original electronically signed document, which is valid \
and considered official according to the Portuguese Law. \
 \
To get the access code for your registration declaration, go to the following \
