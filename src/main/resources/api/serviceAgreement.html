<h2 style="text-align: center;">FenixEdu REST API</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Service Agreement</i></h3>
<p>This FenixEdu REST API Service Agreement contains the terms and conditions that govern the use of the FenixEdu REST API and of all the data feeds provided by Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) using this API. This is a legal agreement between you and IST. By accepting this agreement or accessing the API you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Service Agreement. In case you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you confirm that you have the authority to bind that entity, its affiliates to the terms and conditions of this agreement, in which case the term “you” refers to such entity and affiliates. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms or conditions, you must not accept this agreement and may not use this service.</p>
<p>IST may at any time change these terms or conditions. If such a case arises, you will be notified with reasonable advance and service continuity will be subject to the explicit acceptance of the new conditions. New features that augment or enhance the current service shall be subject to these same terms and conditions of service.</p>
<p>Violation of any of these terms or conditions will result in the termination of your account as well as the suspension of the provided service. The services provided by the FenixEdu REST API will be provided "as is". While IST will make its best effort to ensure service reliability, in any case IST may not be liable for any loss, direct or consequential, of failure of such services.</p>
<p>Usage of the FenixEdu REST API service provided by IST are additionally subject to the regulations defined by the Computer and Network Services division (DSI, Direcção de Serviços de Informática) of IST as well as any applicable legislation approved by the Portuguese government and/or by the European Union.</p>
<p>The use of the FenixEDU REST API is provided under the assumption of fair use by client applications. In case of excessive use or when deemed appropriate, DSI may introduce reasonable throttling in client requests and, in extreme cases, to temporarily or permanently suspend the service to a single client, subset of clients or all clients if there is any risk of compromise of the overall service performance.</p>

<h3>Client Registration</h3>
<p>All client applications of the FenixEdu REST API that access the data feeds provided by IST must be registered using a valid account with DSI. The personal identification and contact information associated with your account must be registered and up to date. You must be a human. Client applications registered by any automated methods are not permitted. The usage of your account must comply with the rules and regulations stipulated by DSI.</p>
<p>In any case where there are reasonable doubts about the compliance of the client applications with these conditions and terms of service, DSI may request access to the source code of the client application for validation and verification purposes. If you do not comply with this request, service may be interrupted at any time. Such access to the source code will not affect the ownership or copyright conditions of the original author. DSI will not distribute or use this code in any other manner or for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Each client application will be assigned identification credentials. The identification credentials may only be used by the client application for which the credentials were assigned. You may not supply these credentials to third parties. You may only use these credentials in the registered client application.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for properly unregistering your client applications. An email or phone request to unregister your client is not considered unregistering. You can unregister your client application at any time using your account at the information systems of IST.</p>
<p>IST, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your use of the API and refuse any and all current or future use of the service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the service will result in the unregistration of your client applications. IST reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

<p>You agree to allow IST to freely publicise the following information regarding all your client applications of the FenixEdu API:</p>
<ul>
	<li>application name;</li>
	<li>author or authors;</li>
	<li>description or purpose;</li>
	<li>release history;
	<li>accessed endpoints;</li>
	<li>logo;</li>
	<li>URL for accessing or downloading the application;</li>
	<li>usage statistics of the application collected by the FenixEdu API.</li>
</ul>
<h3 >Usage of the FenixEdu API</h3>
<p>You may only access the FenixEdu API directly or via a registered client application. You may not access the API by any other means, for example the use of an API through a third-party product that accesses this service. The client application must adhere and conform to the adopted REST protocol as well as to the OAuth 2.0 authentication standard as it is implemented by IST.</p>
<p>Use of each endpoint of the FenixEdu REST API requires specific authentication. Public endpoints only require authentication of the client application. Non-public endpoints require both the authentication of the client application as well as the authorization of the end user who grants that client application access to a given subset of information (accessible to that user) provided by the API which may have visibility restrictions. Any redistribution or publication of reserved data in violation of the visibility provided by the original FenixEdu interfaces is strictly forbidden. This restriction is also applicable to any derived work, including statistical results obtained from the above mentioned data, unless such republication was explicitly authorized by IST.</p>
 
<p>You may not use the service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose or violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws). You will respect the privacy and the rights of all end users and not manipulate or maintain their information without their explicit consent.</p>
<p>You expressly understand and agree that IST will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if IST has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API.</p>
<p>Abusive or excessively frequent requests to the FenixEdu REST API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of the service. Abuse or excessive usage of the service will solely be determined by IST. The suspension or termination of the service may occur without prior notification.</p>
<p>IST reserves the right to modify or discontinue your access to the API (or to any part thereof) with or without notice.</p>
<p>The content delivered by the API is either the intellectual property of IST or of its members (in case of personal information). Usage of all content delivered by this API must respect copyright law and be manipulated with strict preservation of all users personal privacy rights. Use of a users personal information may only occur with his/her explicit and prior consent.</p>
<p>Client applications may not use the FenixEdu API to override authorizations required to access content delivered by the API. The content delivered by the API may only be made available to end users who would already have access to that content via the information systems of IST. This restriction also applies to all derivative work.</p>
<p>Each client application must transparently convey to its end users:
<ul>
	<li>how it will manipulate content delivered by the API;</li>
	<li>the copyright of the content delivered by the API;</li>
	<li>how long it will maintain the delivered content as well as any derivative work;</li>
	<li>how users can completely and permanently remove all content stored and delivered on their behalf to the client application as well as any derivative work.</li>
</ul>

<p>All end users have the right to require that all content stored and delivered on their behalf as well as any derivative work be completely and permanently removed from the client application and any and all means of storage used by you.</p>
<p>The unregistration of a client application requires you to completely and permanently remove the content delivered by the FenixEdu API as well as all derivative work from the client application and any and all means of storage used by you.</p>
<p>The termination of service to a client application requires you to completely and permanently remove the content delivered by the FenixEdu API as well as all derivative work from the client application and any and all means of storage used by you.</p>
